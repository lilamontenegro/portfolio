    <p class="text1">This game is about a colony of ants that get attacked 
    by a human outsider. 
    And now, forced to leave home, you and the others need to escape! 
    But since leaving alone is impossible, with that many obstacles in the way, 
    gather all your friends and, with everyones help,
    find an exit and escape the anthill!<br><br>
    I worked with game design and Audio in this game.<br></p>

    <p class="text2">P.E.B.A. Spaceship is a two player game in which every decision must be 
        well planned. Each room allows you to create an item, use it wisely and work with your
        teammate to repair the ship.  <br><br>
